# Quantify Your Year: JPL's Quantified Year

Current version: **`v0.1.1`**
Last Data Update: **`March-11-2022`**
(I'll update the data aprox once per month...)

Calendar-based visualization of one kind of activity over the course of a calendar year
It is a tool to help me keep track of my hours dedicated for coding and for keeping healthy.

---

#### _`Coding hours per day:`_

1. For keeping track of coding hours, I use watson. https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson
   For the moment, I save watson files to a Json that I translate it to this app Json data file.

#### _`Exercising & fitness training in minutes per day:`_

2. Since you can only track only one kind of activity with this app, I chose to count the minutes while doing "exercise", however:

   - 60min = Means I went boxing with my friend [@hesosa88](https://www.instagram.com/hesosa88/ "@hesosa88")

   - 90min = I went in bicycle to the river park and then done a 60mins open air CrossFit at that same park with [@crosszonevtelopez](https://www.instagram.com/crosszonevtelopez/ "@crosszonevtelopez")
   - 120 A) = crossfit open air (90m) + weight lifting at home at noon (30m)
   - 120 B) = I went boxing (60m) + weight lifting at the boxing gym (60m)
   - 150min = I went crossfit open air 2 rounds in a day, adding exclusive legs work.
   - 180 = I went crossfit open air 2 rounds + weight lifting at home at noon.
